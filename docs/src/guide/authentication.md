# Authentication

The API uses token based authentication with OAuth. You will need to request a token and pass that token when requesting data from the API. Every organization has to request their own API key and secret through the What'sUp 24/7 platform. However, each organization can request multiple keys for different projects.

## Requesting an API Key & Secret

1. **Login** into the What'sUp 24/7 Platform

2. **Enter** the Organization Dashboard Menu

## Reviewing Your API Keys

In the developers area, it will keep a list all API keys requested. However, you will need to store the secret for the key immediately after the key's creation because we won't display the secret again. This is what you should see if you API key was successfully generated and stored.
