# Introduction

This API gives developers the ability to access any event, directory and destination data in their various projects. Because we believe to creating a quality of life around each individual that uses our platform, we built this API to further extended our platform. Users can not only have our data on their website, they will now be able to control the look and feel that data.

<!-- We ask all users of this API to partner with us in helping us keep this content up to date by reporting any issues if you believe the documentation is unclear or incorrect. We want to make sure that everyone is able to use our API with ease. -->
